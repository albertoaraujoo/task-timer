# Task Timer Web App

This project allows the user to create timed tasks for themselves. The app also features a page with the history of tasks.

## üî• Introduction

The project creates tasks with a maximum duration of 60 minutes and a minimum of 5. You can view the task history in the history tab. This was a project from Rocketseat's React track. In this project, I was able to apply a lot of knowledge in React as well as other libraries such as react-hook-form, react-router-dom, immer js, and date-fns. Additionally, important React concepts are practiced such as the use of hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.

The project did not have a responsive design, so I only added a brief fix for that to make the experience more 'acceptable.' However, especially on the history page, we don't have a perfect optimization for mobile. Nevertheless, everything works and the web version was designed for web devices in its original conception.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. Additionally, install the MetaMask wallet extension in your browser.

You will also need a code editor, such as VSCode or Sublime Text, to work on the project.

Make sure your development environment is properly configured to work with React and Vite projects.
